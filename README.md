# SENG513-Perspectiv
This project proposes a re-design to the current Deviant Art Website. The purpose of the website is to provide artists with an outlet so they can showcase their work for others to see, as well as to gather inspiration and ideas from other artists. 

### Quickstart

To build the project, be sure to install MAMP (for mac) or WAMP (for pc). You will need to create a database to store all the images and user profiles as well. The main page file is Main.php. Open this file in your preferred web browser and feel free to navigate around the site!

In the case you want to have a quick preview of the how the site looks, install Atom as well as the Preview HTML package. Download this repository and click on any .php file then enable Preview.
